# Scrum Poker API  

A robust backend for the Scrum Poker application, built with **.NET** and following the **CQRS** pattern with **Mediator Design Pattern** for clear separation of concerns. The API enables room creation, user management, and real-time communication with **SignalR**.

## Features  

### ðŸŒŸ Core Functionalities  
- **CQRS with Mediator Pattern:**  
  - Commands and queries are separated to ensure a clean architecture.  
  - Decoupled communication between components for improved scalability.  

- **Database Design:**  
  - **PostgreSQL** as the database for high performance and scalability.  
  - Dynamic mapping using **Entity Framework Core**.  
  - LINQ Query Syntax for efficient and readable database queries.  

- **Real-Time Communication:**  
  - SignalR integration for live updates and notifications.  
  - Room and user synchronization across clients.
